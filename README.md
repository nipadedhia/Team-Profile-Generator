## Project Description

The Team Profile Generator is a command-line-input application run in Node that requests information from the user about members of an engineering team and generates an HTML file displaying that information. Before running the application the user must perform an npm install to install all required dependencies.

When all information on the team member has been entered, the HTML file is created with cards displaying the information on all the team members entered by the user in the "outputs" folder titled "team.html." A screenshot of an example team profile is shown below:
